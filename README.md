# express + webpack + react + babel + pouchdb

A simple boiler plate for a messaging app backed by a data store. It uses:

- **express** as an application server. (using the default boilerplate. kinda)
- **webpack + babel** to build, bundle and generally be like the cool kids
- **React** 
- **PouchDB** for local storage and syncing with a remote CouchDB instance (expected at localhost:5984).

No routing, no templates and no tests.

*This is a reference for future self. If you are here by mistake you should probably find a better boilerplate.*
